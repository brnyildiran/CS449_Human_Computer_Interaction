## Project Title:
Exploring the Impact of Visual Design and Brand Identity on the Efficiency and Usability of Hepsiburada and Trendyol Mobile Apps

## Project Description:
This study aims to investigate the relationship between visual design and brand identity and their
effect on the usability and efficiency of mobile e-commerce apps, specifically Trendyol and
Hepsiburada. The research methodology includes an examination of the visual design and brand
identity elements of both companies, data collection through usability testing, and analysis of the
results to identify patterns and trends. Participants are divided into groups based on gender (male
and female) and occupation (university students and employed individuals). During the usability
testing, participants are asked to perform tasks such as searching for products, using filtering and
sorting options, reading reviews, adding items to a cart, and completing a purchase. The duration
of task completion for each participant is recorded for further analysis. Additionally, participants
are asked to fill out a questionnaire about their perceptions of the visual design and brand
identity of the apps based on their experiences during the usability testing. The study found that
the average usage rate of Trendyol is higher than Hepsiburada, but both companies failed to
create a strong brand identity that was effective for all demographic groups. Additionally, the
study also found that task completion duration is an important measure of user experience, and
that eCommerce companies should focus on creating a strong brand identity and visually
appealing elements such as colors, images and layout to catch users' attention and encourage
them to explore products. The final outcome of the study will be a report containing
recommendations for improving the visual design and brand identity of the apps to enhance user
experience and enhance the success of the businesses.
